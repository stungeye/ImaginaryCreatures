## Table of Contents

1. Hipster Hippogriff
2. The Spaghetti Yeti
3. Caffeinated Centaur

## Hipster Hippogriff

Sporting oversized glasses and an ironic mustache, the Hipster Hippogrif was into mythical creatures before they were cool. 

It roams the independent music shops of the realm, always on the lookout for the next obscure vinyl record to consume. This is an addition.

He faced discrimination for being a hipster in a blue collared neighbourhood. Everyone hated them. But now they leave in NYC and are cherrished. 

They may commonly be found in alleys, doing a mating dance called drug dealing.

## The Spaghetti Yeti

This high-altitude creature roams the mountainous regions of italy, leaving trails of marinara sauce in its wake. 

Often confused with the traditional Yeti, the Spaghetti Yeti is known for its deliciously tangled fur and insatiable appetite for meatballs.

Each spaghetti strand on the Yeti is a rare variant of tapeworm, that when consumed, forcefully transforms primates into Spaghetti Yetis.

## Caffeinated Centaur

Originating from the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia, this creature can outrun any animal after having its morning brew. 

If you hear the galloping sound of hoves and smell a rich dark roast, you know the Caffeinated Centaur isn't far away.

Caffeinated Centaurs were once normal people from Ethiopia, having mutated after consumed radioactive coffee beans from the nearby destroyed nuclear plants. 

It's been said that the farmers refused to move their crops away from radioactive material, which caused the mutation.

## OwlBear

An Owlbear is a large, ferocious, predatory monster with the body of a bear and the head of an owl, characterized by thick fur and feathers, a hooked, serrated beak, large round eyes, and sharp talons. 

Standing approximately 8 feet tall and weighing up to 1,500 pounds, these creatures are known for their aggression, ill-temper, and a terrifying screech. 

They typically inhabit dense forests and caves, hunting alone or in mated pairs to satisfy their voracious appetites.
