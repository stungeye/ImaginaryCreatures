## Hipster Hippogriff

Sporting oversized glasses and an ironic mustache, the Hipster Hippogrif was into mythical creatures before they were cool. 

It roams the independent music shops of the realm, always on the lookout for the next obscure vinyl record to consume.

He faced discrimination for being a hipster in a blue collared neighbourhood. Everyone hated them. But now they leave in NYC and are cherrished. 

They may commonly be found in alleys, doing a mating dance called drug dealing.

## The Spaghetti Dolphin

This high-altitude creature roams the mountainous regions of italy, leaving trails of marinara sauce in its wake. 

Often confused with the traditional Dolphin, the Spaghetti Dolphin is known for its deliciously tangled fur and insatiable appetite for meatballs.

Each spaghetti strand on the Dolphin is a rare variant of tapeworm, that when consumed, forcefully transforms primates into Spaghetti Dolphins.

## Red Caffeinated Centaur

Redbull is supposed to give you wings, but it gave this guy a horse :) .

## Six Eyed Lion

It's a lion with six eyes, what do want me to say.

## Longs Cat

The long cat is a monstrous creature. It looks much like a incredibliy ugly cat, but don't be fooled! this kitty is slightly longer.

## Buff Bunny

Seriously Yolked bunny, that is humanoid but still has a cute face. Rumors has it that Buff Bunnies eat their weaker brothers and sisters in order to reach the state they are in now.

## Simulacrum Abyss Flower

A flower.

## Bulbasaur

The grass type starter from pokemon the worst one.
