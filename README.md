# Unofficial Guide to Imaginary Creatures ðŸ¦„

Welcome to the most comprehensive guide about creatures that... well, don't actually exist. 

## Table of Contents

1. Hipster Hippogriff
2. The Spaghetti Yeti
3. Caffeinated Centaur

## Hipster Hippogriff

Sporting oversized glasses and an ironic mustache, the Hipster Hippogriff was into mythical creatures before they were cool. 

It roams the independent music shops of the realm, always on the lookout for the next obscure vinyl record to consume.

## The Spaghetti Yeti

This high-altitude creature roams the mountainous regions of Italy, leaving trails of marinara sauce in its wake. 

Often confused with the traditional Yeti, the Spaghetti Yeti is known for its deliciously tangled fur and insatiable appetite for meatballs.

## Caffeinated Centaur

Originating from the ancient coffee forests of Ethiopia, this creature can outrun any animal after having its morning brew. 

If you hear the galloping sound of hooves and smell a rich dark roast, you know the Caffeinated Centaur isn't far away.

## One Eyed Lion

It's a lion with one eye what do want me to say.

## Long Cat

The long cat is a subtle creature. It looks much like a normal cat, but don't be fooled! this cat is slightly longer.

## Simulacrum Abyss Flower

A rare magic flower from Pandemonium, the Simulacrum is a omnivorous plant buried deep underground in an organic expandable carapace, and aggressively consumes and absorbs the vitality and intelligence of any living being.
It produces mimics that imitate its preyâ€™s behavior accurately, no matter how complex, and slowly replaces all life within its growing area of influence.
When devouring intelligent life forms such as humans, the faces of these victims are embedded onto the shell underground, and tendrils sprout up to the surface to mimic their behaviors.
